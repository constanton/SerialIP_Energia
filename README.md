# SerialIP for Energia (TI boards)

This is a fork to the SerialIP version 1.0 library. It's been configured to work on Energia (http://energia.nu/). Tested with MSP430FR5969. Not sure it'll work on boards with less SRAM than 2KB.

Description from the original repository:

This is SerialIP version 1.0, a wrapper library around uIP, which provides the 
Arduino with TCP/IP connectivity over its built-in serial port.

The wrapper library was written by Adam Nielsen <malvineous@shikadi.net>

uIP was written by Adam Dunkels of the Networked Embedded Systems group at the 
Swedish Institute of Computer Science.
